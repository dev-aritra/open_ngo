This is a flutter UI challenege project, where I will take on UI design and will try to implement that in Flutter.

# UI challenge

![design](https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/386883/screenshots/5702327/08122018-dribbble_2x.png)
<br/>




Please note that as I have the screenshots only and not exact measurements, fonts, colors, the implementation would vary from the design.

## Let's build

# 1. Login page
The login page I developed looks like
<br/>
<br/>
![design](screenshots/login.jpg)

Close enough right? :smirk:

# 2. Landing Page
So my implementation looks like
<br/>
<br/>
![design](screenshots/home.jpg)

Could not find the heart icon in flutter Icons, hence the alteration. Still pretty close though :boom:

# 3. Charities page
This is what I built
<br/>
<br/>
![design](screenshots/charities.jpg)

Altered the user's picture here, for obvious reasons :joy:

<br/>

# 3. Charity details page
Tried to replicate as much as I could
<br/>
<br/>
![design](screenshots/details.jpg)

Looks pretty good to me :heartpulse:



# This is pretty much what I wanted to achieve
